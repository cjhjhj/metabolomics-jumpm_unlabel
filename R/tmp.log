  Feature calibration
  ===================

  IROA_IS_NEG_2.feature is chosen as the reference run

  IROA_IS_NEG_1.feature is being aligned against the reference run (it may take a while)
  Global calibration of RT and m/z is being performed
    Based on the matched features within +/- 20 ppm
    The global RT-shift is 1.5000 second
    The global m/z-shift is -0.1287 ppm
    RT and m/z of the compared sample is calibrated according to the global RT- and m/z-shift
  Local calibration of RT and m/z is being performed (through LOESS modeling)
    RT- and m/z-tolerances will be dynamically estimated over RT- and m/z-range as follows
      RT- and m/z-tolerance = 5 x dynamically estimated SD of RT- and m/z-shifts
    LOESS modeling may take some time. Please be patient ...
    The 1st round of RT-calibration is done

  Calibration summary
    After calibration, RT- and m/z-shifts of each run (against a reference run) are centered to zero
    Variations (i.e. standard deviation) of RT- and m/z-shifts are as follows
